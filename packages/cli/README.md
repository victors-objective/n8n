## Demo

[:tv: A short demo (< 3 min)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3w7xIMKLVAg)
which shows how to create a simple workflow which automatically sends a new
Slack notification every time a Github repository received or lost a star.


## Available integrations

n8n has 200+ different nodes to automate workflows. The list can be found on: [https://n8n.io/nodes](https://n8n.io/nodes)


## Documentation

The official n8n documentation can be found under: [https://docs.n8n.io](https://docs.n8n.io)

Additional information and example workflows on the n8n.io website: [https://n8n.io](https://n8n.io)


## Create Custom Nodes

It is very easy to create own nodes for n8n. More information about that can
be found in the documentation of "n8n-node-dev" which is a small CLI which
helps with n8n-node-development.

## What does n8n mean and how do you pronounce it?

**Short answer:** It means "nodemation" and it is pronounced as n-eight-n.

**Long answer:** I get that question quite often (more often than I expected)
so I decided it is probably best to answer it here. While looking for a
good name for the project with a free domain I realized very quickly that all the
good ones I could think of were already taken. So, in the end, I chose
nodemation. "node-" in the sense that it uses a Node-View and that it uses
Node.js and "-mation" for "automation" which is what the project is supposed to help with.
However, I did not like how long the name was and I could not imagine writing
something that long every time in the CLI. That is when I then ended up on
"n8n". Sure does not work perfectly but does neither for Kubernetes (k8s) and
did not hear anybody complain there. So I guess it should be ok.
